# RAM-CPU-Eater.
Have you ever wondered how it feels like to stress your RAM like you are playing Elden Ring on 1 gigabyte of RAM? Well this so-called, i do not know if you can even call this a "virus" can apparently recreate that fact into reality, and maybe fuck around with your CPU along the way, how does that sound?

The only way you can stop this madness, is task-managing your way out, Oh and don't be surprised when Task Manager throws the middle finger pop up saying "LOW MEMORY, PLEASE END TASK SOME PROGRAMS, CAN'T GIVE YOU SHIT ANYWAY". That's fine, Sometimes you gotta exit, and re-open Task Manager so they don't flip you off a second time, or maybe a third?

For the people who use ancient PC's, You're fucked really bad, like deadass, Your PC would blue screen of death once this exe file is executed, or maybe?

For the people who use the most modern PC, You are completely fine, maybe a few lagging and stuttering, but that's about it.

Use it at your own risk, or be a redneck if you are a reckless guy, Either way, stay safe.
